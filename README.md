### Functionality includes:

* MD5 Hashing

The entropy of a password is used to measure how "strong" or complex your password is. 

Password strength is determined with this chart:
< 28 bits = Very Weak
28 - 35 bits = Weak
36 - 59 bits = Reasonable
60 - 127 bits = Strong
128+ bits = Very Strong

This program also uses lists of the most common passwords, phrases and first names to generate common patterns of an inputted password. Additionally, the MD5 hashing functionality can take in a list of words and use it against a list of hashes to see if any words/passwords can be "Cracked" using a dictionary attack.
### Usage:
All input files are in .txt format, simple run the program and follow the prompts.

This program uses the lists of the most common passwords, phrases and first names to generate a 
a list of common patterns that can be seen within your inputted password.
